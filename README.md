<h1>ClassCal API Facade</h1>
<p>A JS facade for using the classcal API. This simplfies a lot of the AJAX with wrapper functions that take a callback function and json data as parameters.</p>
<p>A test html page is included with some examples, but this is mostly for me to test the functions during development</p>
<p><strong>This is dependant on jquery to use.</strong></p>
